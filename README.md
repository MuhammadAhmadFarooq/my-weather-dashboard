## Installation and Running the Project Locally

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmadFarooq912/my-weather-dashboard
   cd my-weather-dashboard
   ```

2. **Obtain API Keys**:

   Sign up for API keys at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Gemini AI](https://gemini.com/api) (or the appropriate link). Replace the `apiKey` variable in `script.js` with your actual key:

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your actual API key
   ```

3. **Open the Project in a Browser**:

   - You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser by navigating to the cloned folder and double-clicking on `index.html`.

   - For a better experience (especially for AJAX requests), serve the files using a local server. Here are two simple methods:

     - **Using Live Server Extension in Visual Studio Code**:
       - Install the **Live Server** extension.
       - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."

## Usage

- Use the search bar to look up weather information for different locations.
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit using the unit switch.
- View detailed weather data in the table view.
- Use the chatbot for natural language queries about weather conditions.

## Customization

- Modify the CSS in `styles.css` to change the dashboard's appearance.
- Adjust chart configurations and data processing logic in `script.js` as needed.
